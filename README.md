# Rust Basic Blockchain

## Description

A basic implementation of a blockchain written in Rust. It's intended as a learning tool for understanding the fundamental principles of how a blockchain works. 

The program creates a simple blockchain, adds blocks to it, and then prints all the blocks. Each block contains an index, a timestamp, data, a previous block hash, and its own hash. 

## Usage 

To run the program, you'll need Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RustSimpleBlockchain.git
```

Navigate into the repository:
```
cd RustSimpleBlockchain
```

Run the program:
```
cargo run 
```

The output will display the blocks in your simple blockchain.
